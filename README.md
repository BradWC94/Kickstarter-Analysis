# Kickstarter-Analysis
Analysis of campaign outcomes based on their launch dates and funding goals.

## Overview of Project
Louise is a playwright currently running a campaing to raise funds for her play, Fever. She is close to her funding goal, but is curious as to how other similar campaigns did in relation to their launch dates and funding goals. I performed some calculations and analysis within excel on similar campaigns to help her out.

### Purpose
The purpose of the project is to give Louise some insignt to how similar funding campaigns performed in relation to launch dates and funding goals.

## Analysis and Challenges
My analysis began by creating a pivot table that allowed me to look at the outcomes of different funding campaigns in relation to their launch dates. The pivot table showed the launch dates of campaigns (according to month) over several years. I then created a line chart based on the pivot table so that it would be easier to visualize.

The next step I took was to create a table that showed the success, failure, and cancelation percentages of different funding campaigns grouped in relation to the amount of their goal funding. I did this in order to analyze the outcomes of different funding campaigns in relation to their funding goals. After this I reated a line chart so that the data would be easier to visualize.

## Results
- May is the most successful launch month based on the data. There were 111 successful campaigns launched in that month which is more than any of the other months. December seems to be the worst launch month based on the data. There were only 37 successful campaigns launched in the month of December compared to 35 that failed in the same month.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
